RC6Block
================

Modern implementation of RC6 encryption in python.

Tested with a cpp implementation.

## Info

* Block size : 32 bytes with 4 chunks.

* Key size : 16 bytes

* Rounds: 12

## Features

* In cryptography, RC6 (Rivest Cipher 6) is a symmetric key block cipher derived from RC5. 

* It was designed by Ron Rivest, Matt Robshaw, Ray Sidney, and Yiqun Lisa Yin

* It was designed to meet the requirements of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) competition. 

* It is a proprietary algorithm, patented by RSA Security.

## Functions

* encrypt.py and decrypt.py are used to encrypt and decrypt using user input

* cenc.py and cdec.py are used to encrypt and decrypt using command line input

* helper.py contains helper functions
